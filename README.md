# Palantir
A bot that helps connect reddit usernames to discord accounts. Discord released similar functionality natively but once you add your profile it is publicly viewable. Using Palantir you can help members keep this information private and only for moderators.

## Palantir does the following:
### Set Username
Users can set their username so their reddit profile becomes associated with their discord profile

### Get Username
Moderators can see the reddit username of the discord user

### Modify The Username
Moderators can change a user's associated reddit username

### Track Name Changes
Palantir also tracks discord handle changes. Once a logging channel has been set up and configured, Palantir will inform this channel of changes to usernames so you will always know who is who in your server.
